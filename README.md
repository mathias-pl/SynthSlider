# SynthSlider
*A customizable digital music instrument using Arduino and Lego pieces*

## Goal
Create a hardware piece that can generate specific sounds thanks to a slider and a button.

## Design
### Software Used
- LeoCAD: Create a digital twin for the Lego components that have the role of slider.
- Autodesk Tinkercad: Create a digital twin for the Arduino board & components to streamline the assembly afterwards.
- Arduino IDE: Code the software that the Arduino Uno will run to make everything work.
  
### Electric Components Required
- 1x Arduino Uno R3
- 1x 3D-printed case
- 1x Screw
- 1x Small Breadboard
- 1x Passive Buzzer
- 1x Pushbutton
- 1x Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (*HC-SR04*)
- 8x Cables

### Development Steps
1) Build the Lego slider according to the LeoCAD model.
2) Build the Lego sliding piece according to the LeoCAD model.
3) Insert the buzzer, the button & the ultrasonic distance sensor on the breadboard.
4) Put the Arduino in its 3D-printed case.
5) Connect the appropriate cables to the Arduino board.
6) Screw the Arduino in the case.
7) Connect the Arduino to a computer.
8) Upload the given code and run it.


## Results
### Challenges
- Make all the components fit on a small board.
- Find the correct polling rate for the sensor.
- Find the optimal size for the Lego slider so that it is accurately detectable by the sensor.

### Images
*It is to be noted that the actual Lego parts aren't exactly representative of the CAD model due to piece scarcity.*<br>
